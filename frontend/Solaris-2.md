# Solaris-2

A long time ago, scientists have discovered a habitable moon on the 7th ring of
Saturn. They called it Solaris-2 and with the funding of an international
committee, they built a space shuttle called *Ark*. 10 years ago, *Ark* was
sent to Solaris-2 with 1000 species of creatures to begin colonization.

Two years ago, we lost all communication with the colonists. We had no clue to
what was happening there until now. Yet our last efforts to establish
communication with them was successful; we got data from the implants on the
creatures. According to the data, some of the creatures survived, some died in
a few days, and we didn’t receive data from some of them.

We have data about the properties of these creatures, and the fact that if they
are dead, alive or unreachable. If we can visualize this data, we can better
understand the common properties of the creatures that survived.

What we want from you is to interactively visualize the data in a way that you
find the most appropriate. Scientist will use this application to analyze which
kinds of creatures can survive. If they can do it using the application you
wrote, they’ll use it to analyze data from other habitable moons.

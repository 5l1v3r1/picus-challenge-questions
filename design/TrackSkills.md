# ACME Co. Challenge Brief

## Company profile

### History

ACME was founded in 2010 and has been developing web and mobile apps
ever since. Its flagship product is a grocery list app. It’s been
funded by big investment firms and has been growing steadily.

### Specialization

ACME is specialized in B2C apps with great design and ease of
use. Even though app stores are saturated with apps of all kinds, ACME
thinks simple and elegant apps can be a great differentiator and its
growth is a proof of that.

## Problem statement

### Description

ACME wants to develop a new app for tracking skills. The users can see
skills from a variety of professions and pick those they already know,
want to learn and learning right now. They need to see these skills as
a tree where leaves are the skills and branches are the categories and
subcategories. They should also be able to see them categorized by
other aspects, like difficulty. Also it should be easy to see tracked
skills and modify or remove them.

### Contraints

* The number of subcategories a category has is not relevant to the
user. A category may have 15 subcategories while another has only 3,
this doesn’t need to be conveyed to the user.  

* Users should be able to track a category or subcategory of skills,
not only a single skill.

## Goals

The output should be for a web application. It should be easy to understand how
the app works, see which skills are currently tracked, find a new skill to 
track and untrack a skill. Viewing the tree and changing the aspect should be
intuitive.

## Notes

* You should use your design process to start from definition of the
problem to actual screen designs and design handoffs. These don’t have
to be high fidelity.

* It’s more important to have artifacts from each step than perfecting
only the first step. 

* You will have 48 hours to complete the challenge and send design
artifacts to us, you’ll also present them in our next meeting.

* You can fill in the blanks if you need, like user research; we don’t
want you to actually perform it.

# Alan Turing's 101th Birthday


In 2013, Alan Turing, who was born in 1912, would be 101 if he lived.

Decimal number 101 is prime. If you take it as a binary number (101b)
its decimal representation 5d is also prime.

Decimal 11 has the same property. 11d is prime and 11b when
converted to decimal is 3d which is also prime.

Below are two more decimals which have the same property.

```
10111 (5bit)
111111111111111111111111011101 (30 bit)
```

How many 30 bit prime tuples are there which have this property? Write a
program which efficiently calculates the solution.
